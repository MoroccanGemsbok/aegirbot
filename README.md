aegir bot discord bot

This Discord bot was created using the (now-outdated) Discord.py 1.0 Python library. It is capable of returning pictures and texts in response to commands. 
It is hosted via Heroku.
Because this bot was made to only be used in a particular Discord server with my friends, many of the functions may not work, or are confusing.
